*   `click` Function
*   `tooltip` String (optional) - The text of the button's tooltip.

*   `disabled` - The button is disabled. It is present, but has a visual state indicating it will not respond to user action.
*   `dismissonclick` - When the button is clicked, the thumbnail window closes immediately.
