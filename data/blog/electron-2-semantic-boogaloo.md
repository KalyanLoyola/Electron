**tl;dr**

```
$ npm install --save-dev electron
```

A new major version of Electron is in the works, and with it some changes to our versioning strategy. 
As of version 2.0.0, Electron will strictly adhere to Semantic Versioning. This will mean a few things practically:

- Youâ€™ll see the major version bump more often.
  Have no fear, it will usually be a major update to Chromium.
- In addition, one of our most requested features has been more stability in our patch releases.
  Patch releases will now only contain bug fixes with no new features.
