## Release Process

The [App Feedback Program](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/3-0-x/docs/tutorial/app-feedback-program.md) we instituted during the development of Electron 3.0 was successful, so we continued the program for the 4.0 branch as well. We'd like to extend a massive thank you to Atlassian, Atom, Microsoft Teams, Oculus, OpenFin, Slack, Symphony, VS Code, and other program members for their involvement in this program during the 4.0 beta cycle. If you'd like to participate in future betas, please mail us at [info@electronjs.org](mailto:info@electronjs.org).

# What's Next

The Electron team has been focusing on maintaining parity with the development cadences of Chromium, Node, and V8 as much as possible, and we plan to continue this trend going forward. See our [Planned Breaking Changes doc](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/breaking-changes.md) for information on upcoming breaking changes planned for future versions of Electron.
