## App Feedback Program

The [App Feedback Program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program) we instituted during the development of Electron 3.0 was successful, so we've continued it during the development of 4.0 as well. We'd like to extend a massive thank you to Atlassian, Atom, Microsoft Teams, Oculus, OpenFin, Slack, Symphony, VS Code, and other program members for their involvement in the program during the 4.0 beta cycle. To learn more about the App Feedback Program and to participate in future betas, check out [our blog post about the program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program).

# What's Next

The Electron team has been focusing on maintaining parity with the development cadences of Chromium, Node, and V8 as much as possible, and we plan to continue this trend going forward. See our [Planned Breaking Changes doc](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/breaking-changes.md) for information on upcoming breaking changes planned for future versions of Electron.
