## End of Support for 3.0.x

Per our [supported versions policy](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-versions), 3.0.x has reached end of life.

## App Feedback Program

We continue to use our [App Feedback Program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program) for testing. Projects who participate in this program test Electron betas on their apps; and in return, the new bugs they find are prioritized for the stable release. If you'd like to participate or learn more, [check out our blog post about the program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program).
