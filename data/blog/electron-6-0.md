## What's New

Today marks a first for the Electron project: this is the first time we've made a stable Electron release **on the same day** as the corresponding [Chrome stable release](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/schedule)! ðŸŽ‰

Much of Electron's functionality is provided by the core components of Chromium, Node.js, and V8. Electron keeps up-to-date with these projects to provide our users with new JavaScript features, performance improvements, and security fixes. Each of these packages has a major version bump in Electron 6:

- Chromium `76.0.3809.80`
  - [New in 74](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/04/nic74)
  - [New in 75](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/06/nic75)
  - [New in 76](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/tags/chrome76)
- Node.js `12.4.0`
  - [Node 12.4.0 blog post](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.4.0/)
- V8 `7.6.303.22`
    - [V8 7.6 blog post](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-76)

This release also includes improvements to Electron's APIs. [The release notes](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v6.0.0) have a more complete list, but here are the highlights:

### Promisification

Electron 6.0 continues the [initiative](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/modernization/promisification.md) started in 5.0 to improve [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises) support.

These functions now return Promises and still support older callback-based invocation:
 * `contentTracing.getCategories()` [#16583](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16583)
 * `contentTracing.getCategories()` [#16583](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16583)
 * `contentTracing.getTraceBufferUsage()` [#16600](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16600)
 * `contents.executeJavaScript()` [#17312](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17312)
 * `cookies.flushStore()` [#16464](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16464)
 * `cookies.get()` [#16464](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16464)
 * `cookies.remove()` [#16464](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16464)
 * `cookies.set()` [#16464](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16464)
 * `dialog.showCertificateTrustDialog()` [#17181](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17181)
 * `inAppPurchase.getProducts()` [#17355](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17355)
 * `inAppPurchase.purchaseProduct()`[#17355](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17355)
 * `netLog.stopLogging()` [#16862](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16862)
 * `session.clearAuthCache()` [#17259](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17259)
 * `session.clearCache()`  [#17185](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17185)
 * `session.clearHostResolverCache()` [#17229](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17229)
 * `session.clearStorageData()` [#17249](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17249)
 * `session.getBlobData()` [#17303](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17303)
 * `session.getCacheSize()`  [#17185](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17185)
 * `session.resolveProxy()` [#17222](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17222)
 * `session.setProxy()`  [#17222](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17222)
 * `webContents.hasServiceWorker()` [#16535](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16535)
 * `webContents.printToPDF()` [#16795](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16795)
 * `webContents.savePage()` [#16742](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16742)
 * `webFrame.executeJavaScript()` [#17312](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17312)
 * `webFrame.executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld()` [#17312](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17312)
 * `webviewTag.executeJavaScript()` [#17312](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17312)

These functions now have two forms, synchronous and Promise-based asynchronous:
 * `dialog.showMessageBox()` [#17298](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17298)
 * `dialog.showOpenDialog()` [#16973](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16973)
 * `dialog.showSaveDialog()` [#17054](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17054)

These functions now return Promises:
 * `app.dock.show()` [#16904](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16904)

### `Electron Helper (Render).app` and `Electron Helper (Plugin).app`
[TODO: fill in details about new Helpers]

## Breaking Changes

### `app.allowRendererProcessReuse` option

This release starts laying the groundwork for a future requirement that native Node modules loaded in the renderer process to be either N-API or Context Aware. The reasons for this change are faster performance, stronger security, and reduced maintenance workload. Read the full details in [this issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18397). This change is expected to complete in Electron v11.

Outline for change:

  * Electron 6: Add option to disable site instance patches [#18396](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/18396)
  * Electron 7: Show deprecation warnings for non-context aware native modules
  * Electron 8: Show deprecation warnings for the default value of `app.allowRendererProcessReuse` to switch
  * Electron 9: Switch the default value of `app.allowRendererProcessReuse`
  * Electron 10: Deprecate the ability to change `app.allowRendererProcessReuse`
  * Electron 11: Remove the ability to change `app.allowRendererProcessReuse`

### Other Breaking Changes

[TODO: need to provide details for the following bullet items or omit from blog post]

  * Fixed disparity between `net` module headers and Node.js'  `http.IncomingMessage` headers. [#17517](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17517)
  * Made `ShowItemInFolder` asynchronous with no return value. [#17121](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17121)
  * Made app log directory creation opt-in with a new function `app.setAppLogsPath`. [#17841](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17841)

## Deprecations

## End of Support for 3.0.x

Per our [supported versions policy](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-versions), 3.0.x has reached end of life. Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a supported version of Electron.

## App Feedback Program

We continue to use our [App Feedback Program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program) for testing. Projects who participate in this program test Electron betas on their apps; and in return, the new bugs they find are prioritized for the stable release. If you'd like to participate or learn more, [check out our blog post about the program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program).

## What's Next

In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8. Although we are careful not to make promises about release dates, our plan is release new major versions of Electron with new versions of those components approximately quarterly. The [tentative 7.0.0 schedule](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-timelines) maps out key dates in the Electron 7 development life cycle. Also, [see our versioning document](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning) for more detailed information about versioning in Electron.
