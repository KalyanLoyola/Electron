## What's New

## Breaking Changes

## Deprecations

## End of Support for 3.0.x

Per our [supported versions policy](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-versions), 3.0.x has reached end of life.

## App Feedback Program

We continue to use our [App Feedback Program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program) for testing. Projects who participate in this program test Electron betas on their apps; and in return, the new bugs they find are prioritized for the stable release. If you'd like to participate or learn more, [check out our blog post about the program](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program).

## What's Next
In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8. Although we are careful not to make promises about release dates, our plan is release new major versions of Electron with new versions of those components approximately quarterly. The [tentative 7.0.0 schedule](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-timelines) maps out key dates in the Electron 7 development life cycle. Also, [see our versioning document](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning) for more detailed information about versioning in Electron.
